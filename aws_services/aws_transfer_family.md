5. **Add a user:**

   * Specify IAM role
   * Set S3 bucket and home directory
   * Upload SSH public key
6. **Start the server**

## 6. Security Configuration

* Use **IAM roles** for controlled access
* Integrate with **AWS Secrets Manager** for credentials
* Enable **CloudWatch logging** for auditing
* Set **IP allowlists** using security groups/VPC endpoints

---

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

* **CloudWatch Logs**: Shows file access activity
* **AWS CloudTrail**: Records API calls
* **CloudWatch Metrics**: Connection counts, upload/download stats

---

## 8. Common Configurations

* Multiple users with isolated folders (chroot-like)
* Custom domain via Route 53 + CloudFront
* Lambda-based identity providers for Active Directory or custom auth

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

* üîÅ **User can't connect?** Check SSH key format or IP restrictions
* üö´ **Permission denied?** Validate IAM role permissions
* üîç **Not seeing logs?** Ensure logging is enabled in server settings

---

## 10. Best Practices

* Prefer **SFTP over FTPS/FTP** for stronger encryption
* Isolate user folders with IAM and logical directories
